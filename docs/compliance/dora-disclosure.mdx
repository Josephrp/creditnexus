## DORA Compliance Disclosure

**Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) - European Union Regulation**

CreditNexus acknowledges the requirements of the Digital Operational Resilience Act (Regulation (EU) 2022/2554), which establishes cybersecurity requirements for financial entities in the European Union.

## Application Status

This application is provided as a **non-production demonstration**. However, users should be aware that:

- Transactions executed through this system may be **live and executory**
- Digital signatures applied through this system have **real legal implications**
- All signees are **legally bound** by transactions based on system configuration
- Users are responsible for understanding the **regulatory and legal implications** of their use

---

## Cybersecurity Measures

CreditNexus implements the following cybersecurity measures to align with DORA requirements:

### Network Security

- **SSL/TLS Encryption**: All API communications use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- **Database SSL**: Production database connections require SSL/TLS (`DB_SSL_REQUIRED=true`)
- **Firewall Rules**: Network-level security controls
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse

**Code Reference**: `docs/SECURITY.md` (lines 129-227), `app/core/config.py` (database SSL configuration)

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission system
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with SHA-256 pre-hashing
- **Session Management**: Configurable token expiration

**Code Reference**: `app/auth/jwt_auth.py`, `app/core/permissions.py`

### Audit Logging

- **Complete Audit Trail**: All state-changing operations are logged
- **7-Year Retention**: Audit logs retained for 7 years (regulatory requirement)
- **CDM Event Logging**: All policy decisions stored as CDM events

**Code Reference**: `app/utils/audit.py`, `app/db/models.py` (AuditLog model)

### Policy-as-Code Enforcement

- **Real-time Compliance**: Policy engine enforces compliance at transaction time
- **Deterministic Rules**: Policy rules are deterministic and auditable
- **18+ Policy Rules**: Comprehensive policy coverage (sanctions, credit risk, ESG, green finance)

**Code Reference**: `app/services/policy_service.py`, `app/policies/`
