## Overview

The Document Extraction workflow allows you to upload credit agreements and automatically extract structured CDM (Common Domain Model) data using AI-powered analysis.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Access Document Parser

Navigate to the **Document Parser** tab in the main application interface.

### 2. Upload Document

Click the upload button and select your credit agreement file. Supported formats:
- PDF (.pdf)
- Word documents (.docx)
- Plain text (.txt)

### 3. Extraction Process

The system automatically:
- Extracts text from the document
- Analyzes content using AI (GPT-4o, vLLM, or HuggingFace)
- Identifies key entities (parties, facilities, terms)
- Structures data according to CDM format
- Validates policy compliance

### 4. Review Extracted Data

Review the extracted information:
- **Credit Agreement**: Main agreement details
- **Parties**: Borrowers, lenders, guarantors
- **Facilities**: Loan facilities and terms
- **Policy Evaluation**: Compliance check results

### 5. Save to Library

Once validated, save the document to your library for future use in document generation or trade execution.

## Extraction Features

### AI-Powered Analysis

CreditNexus uses advanced Large Language Models to understand complex legal text:

### CDM Compliance

All extracted data follows FINOS Common Domain Model standards:
- Standardized data structures

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Document Quality**: Ensure documents are clear and readable
2. **Complete Information**: Include all relevant pages
3. **Standard Formats**: Use standard credit agreement formats when possible
4. **Review Carefully**: Always review extracted data before saving

## Troubleshooting

**Extraction fails or returns incomplete data:**
- Check document format and quality
- Ensure document is not corrupted
- Try re-uploading the document
- Contact support if issues persist

**Policy evaluation blocks extraction:**
- Review policy evaluation details
- Address flagged compliance issues
- Consult compliance team if needed

## Next Steps

After extraction, you can:
- Use data in [Document Generation](/guides/document-generation)
