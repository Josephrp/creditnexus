## CDM Overview

CreditNexus is fully compliant with the FINOS Common Domain Model (CDM), ensuring interoperability with other financial systems and adherence to industry standards.

## CDM Models

All financial data is represented using CDM models:

- **CreditAgreement**: Represents credit facility agreements
- **Party**: Represents counterparties (borrowers, lenders)
- **LoanFacility**: Represents individual loan facilities
- **TradeExecution**: Represents trade execution events
- **PolicyEvaluation**: Represents policy decision events

## Policy Validation

Policy validation is embedded at the point of data creation using Pydantic model validators:

```python
@model_validator(mode='after')
def validate_policy_compliance(self) -> 'CreditAgreement':
    """CDM-compliant validation at point of creation."""
    # Policy checks here
    return self
```

## CDM Events

All state changes and policy decisions are stored as CDM events:

- **TradeExecution Events**: Record trade executions
- **PolicyEvaluation Events**: Record policy decisions
- **Observation Events**: Record observations and verifications

## Event Structure

CDM events include:

- `eventType`: Type of event
- `eventDate`: ISO 8601 timestamp
- `meta.globalKey`: Unique identifier
- `relatedEventIdentifier`: Links to related events
