title: Architecture Overview
description: High-level architecture of CreditNexus
---

## System Architecture

CreditNexus follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Backend Layer

- **API Layer**: FastAPI with dependency injection and Pydantic validation
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and orchestration
- **Data Layer**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 with PostgreSQL
- **Policy Layer**: Policy-as-code engine for compliance enforcement

### Frontend Layer

- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **FDC3 Integration**: Desktop interoperability

### AI/ML Layer

- **LLM Abstraction**: Support for multiple providers (OpenAI, vLLM, HuggingFace)
- **Extraction Chains**: Simple and map-reduce extraction strategies
- **Satellite Analysis**: TorchGeo for NDVI verification

## Data Flow

1. **Document Upload**: User uploads credit agreement
2. **Text Extraction**: Document text is extracted
3. **AI Extraction**: LLM extracts structured CDM data
4. **Policy Validation**: Policy engine validates compliance
5. **CDM Event Creation**: Policy decisions stored as CDM events
6. **Storage**: Data persisted in PostgreSQL with audit logging

## Key Principles

- **CDM Compliance**: All data follows FINOS CDM standards
- **Policy-as-Code**: Deterministic policy enforcement
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript and Pydantic validation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit logging for compliance
