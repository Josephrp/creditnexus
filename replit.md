# CreditNexus

A FINOS-Compliant Financial AI Agent for extracting structured credit agreement data from unstructured legal documents.

## Overview

CreditNexus uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model with LangChain to extract structured, machine-readable data from credit agreements. The extracted data conforms to the FINOS Common Domain Model (CDM), ensuring interoperability with other financial systems.

## Architecture

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Python 3.11
- **AI Engine**: LangChain + OpenAI GPT-4o
- **Port**: 8000 (development), 5000 (production)
- **Key Features**:
  - `/api/extract` - Extracts structured data from credit agreement text
  - `/api/health` - Health check endpoint
  - Automatic strategy selection (simple vs map-reduce) based on document length
  - Reflexion retry pattern for validation error correction
  - Static file serving for production deployment

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React + Vite + TypeScript
- **Port**: 5000
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS
- **Key Features**:
  - Document upload interface
  - Real-time extraction with loading states
  - Review interface for extracted data
  - Approve/reject workflow

### Data Models
All data models follow the FINOS Common Domain Model (CDM) specification:
- `CreditAgreement` - Root object containing all extracted data
- `Party` - Legal entities (Borrower, Lender, Administrative Agent, etc.)
- `LoanFacility` - Individual loan facilities with terms
- `InterestRatePayout` - Interest rate structure and payment frequency
- `Money` - Monetary amounts with currency (using Decimal for precision)
- `FloatingRateOption` - Benchmark rates and spreads (in basis points)

## Development

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required) - OpenAI API key for GPT-4o access

### Running Locally
Both workflows start automatically:
- **Frontend**: `cd client && npm run dev` (port 5000)
- **Backend**: `uvicorn server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload`

### API Proxy
In development, the Vite frontend proxies `/api` requests to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deployment

The application is configured for Replit's autoscale deployment:

1. **Build**: Installs dependencies and builds the frontend
2. **Run**: Starts uvicorn server on port 5000, serving both API and static files
3. **Static Files**: Built frontend is served from `client/dist/`

The backend automatically detects the presence of built static files and serves them in production, falling back to API-only mode if they're not found.

## Key Technical Details

### Extraction Process
1. User uploads a credit agreement document (text)
2. Frontend sends text to `/api/extract` endpoint
3. Backend analyzes document length:
   - **< 50k characters**: Uses simple extraction with structured output
   - **≥ 50k characters**: Uses map-reduce strategy for long documents
4. LLM extracts structured data conforming to CDM schema
5. If validation fails, the error is fed back to the LLM for correction (up to 3 attempts)
6. Frontend displays extracted data for review

### Validation Rules
- Agreement date cannot be in the future
- Facility maturity dates must be after agreement date
- All facilities must use the same currency
- At least one party must have role "Borrower"
- Interest rate spreads are normalized to basis points (3.5% → 350.0)
- All monetary amounts use Decimal for precision
